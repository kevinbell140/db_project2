values
	('Action', 'Should contain numerous scenes where action is spectacular and usually destructive. Note: if a movie contains just one action scene (even if prolonged, e.g., airplane-accident) it does not qualify. Subjective.'),
	('Adult', 'Reserved for explicit works of consenting hardcore sex or sexual activity, or strong fetish material involving adults, specifically those created for the purposes of titillation or arousal. Must be used with the plot keywords of "hardcore" and "sex" or "special-sexual-interest". Documentaries about this type of material do not use the Adult genre. Subjective.'),
	('Adventure', 'Should contain numerous consecutive and inter-related scenes of characters participating in hazardous or exciting experiences for a specific goal. Not to be confused with Action, and should only sometimes be supplied with it. Subjective.'),
	('Animation', 'Over 75% of the title''s running time should have scenes that are wholly, or part-animated. Any form of animation is acceptable, e.g., hand-drawn, computer-generated, stop-motion, etc. Puppetry does not count as animation, unless a form of animation such as stop-motion is also applied. Incidental animated sequences should be indicated with the keywords part-animated or animated-sequence instead. Although the overwhelming majority of video games are a form of animation it''s okay to forgo this genre when adding them as this is implied by the title type. Objective.'),
	('Biography', 'Primary focus is on the depiction of activities and personality of a real person or persons, for some or all of their lifetime. Events in their life may be reenacted, or described in a documentary style. If re-enacted, they should generally follow reasonably close to the factual record, within the limitations of dramatic necessity. A real person in a fictional setting would not qualify a production for this genre. If the focus is primarily on events, rather than a person, use History instead. Objective.'),
	('Comedy', 'Virtually all scenes should contain characters participating in humorous or comedic experiences. The comedy can be exclusively for the viewer, at the expense of the characters in the title, or be shared with them. Please submit qualifying keywords to better describe the humor (i.e. spoof, parody, irony, slapstick, satire, black-comedy etc). If the title does not conform to the "virtually all scenes" guideline then please do not add the comedy genre; instead, submit the same keyword variations described above to signify the comedic elements of the title. Subjective.'),
	('Crime', '	Whether the protagonists or antagonists are criminals this should contain numerous consecutive and inter-related scenes of characters participating, aiding, abetting, and/or planning criminal behavior or experiences usually for an illicit goal. Not to be confused with Film-Noir, and only sometimes should be supplied with it. Subjective.'),
	('Documentary', 'Should contain numerous consecutive scenes of real personages and not characters portrayed by actors. This does not include fake or spoof documentaries, which should instead have the fake-documentary keyword. A documentary that includes actors re-creating events should include the keyword "reenactment" so that those actors are not treated as "Himself." This genre should also be applied to all instances of stand-up comedy and concert performances. Objective.'),
	('Drama', 'Should contain numerous consecutive scenes of characters portrayed to effect a serious narrative throughout the title. This can be exaggerated upon to produce melodrama. Subjective.'),
	('Family', 'Should be universally accepted viewing. e.g., aimed specifically for the education and/or entertainment of children or the entire family. Note: Usually, but not always, complementary to Animation. Objective.'),
	('Fantasy', 'Should contain numerous consecutive scenes of characters portrayed to effect a magical and/or mystical narrative throughout the title. Note: not to be confused with Sci-Fi which is not usually based in magic or mysticism. Subjective.'),
	('Film-Noir', 'Typically features dark, brooding characters, corruption, detectives, and the seedy side of the big city. Almost always shot in black and white, American, and set in contemporary times (relative to shooting date). We take the view that this genre began with Underworld (1927) and ended with Touch of Evil (1958). Note: neo-noir should be submitted as a keyword instead of this genre for titles that do not fit all criteria. Objective.'),
	('Game-Show', 'Competition, other than sports, between, usually, non-professional contestants. The competition can include a physical component, but is usually primarily mental or strategic as opposed to athletic. This also includes what are known as "quiz shows." Talent contests staged expressly for the program are considered Game-Shows. Objective.'),
	('History', 'Primary focus is on real-life events of historical significance featuring real-life characters (allowing for some artistic license); in current terms, the sort of thing that might be expected to dominate the front page of a national newspaper for at least a week; for older times, the sort of thing likely to be included in any major history book. While some characters, incidents, and dialog may be fictional, these should be relatively minor points used primarily to bridge gaps in the record. Use of actual persons in an otherwise fictional setting, or of historic events as a backdrop for a fictional story, would not qualify. If the focus is primarily on one person''s life and character, rather than events of historical scope, use Biography instead. Objective.'),
	('Horror', 'Should contain numerous consecutive scenes of characters effecting a terrifying and/or repugnant narrative throughout the title. Note: not to be confused with Thriller which is not usually based in fear or abhorrence. Subjective.'),
	('Musical', 'Should contain several scenes of characters bursting into song aimed at the viewer (this excludes songs performed for the enjoyment of other characters that may be viewing) while the rest of the time, usually but not exclusively, portraying a narrative that alludes to another Genre. Note: not to be added for titles that are simply music related or have music performances in them; e.g., pop concerts do not apply. Also, classical opera, since it is entirely musical, does not apply and should instead be treated as Music. Objective.'),
	('Music', 'Contains significant music-related elements while not actually being a Musical; this may mean a concert, or a story about a band (either fictional or documentary). Subjective.'),
	('Mystery', 'Should contain numerous inter-related scenes of one or more characters endeavoring to widen their knowledge of anything pertaining to themselves or others. Note: Usually, but not always associated with Crime. Subjective.'),
	('News', 'Reports and discussion of current events of public importance or interest. If the events are not current (at the time the title was initially released), use History instead. This generally includes newsreels, newsmagazines, daily news reports, and commentary/discussion programs that focus on news events. Objective.'),
	('Reality-TV', 'Features non-professionals in an unscripted, but generally staged or manipulated, situation. May or may not use hidden cameras; generally, but not always, in a non-studio setting. Objective.'),
	('Romance', 'Should contain numerous inter-related scenes of a character and their personal life with emphasis on emotional attachment or involvement with other characters, especially those characterized by a high level of purity and devotion. Note: Reminder, as with all genres if this does not describe the movie wholly, but only certain scenes or a subplot, then it should be submitted as a keyword instead. Subjective.'),
	('Sci-Fi', 'Numerous scenes, and/or the entire background for the setting of the narrative, should be based on speculative scientific discoveries or developments, environmental changes, space travel, or life on other planets. Subjective.'),
	('Short', 'Any theatrical film or made-for-video title with a running time of less than 45 minutes, i.e., 44 minutes or less, or any TV series or TV movie with a running time of less than 22 minutes, i.e. 21 minutes or less. (A "half-hour" television program should not be listed as a Short.) If known, please submit the running time if we do not have one on record. Objective.'),
	('Sport', 'Focus is on sports or a sporting event, either fictional or actual. This includes fictional stories focused on a particular sport or event, documentaries about sports, and television broadcasts of actual sporting events. In a fictional film, the sport itself can also be fictional, but it should be the primary focus of the film. Objective.'),

He was sent to Shawshank Prison in 1947. Dufresne was the frequent target of sexual abuse from a prison clique known as the Sisters. His sage financial advice earned him protection from prison guards. Dufresne used his considerable intelligence and education to improve the prison library, which he named after former inmate and librarian Brooks Hatlen, and helped a number of convicts earn their high school diplomas. He also used his banking knowledge to start a money laundering scheme on behalf of prison warden Samuel Norton. In 1966 Dufresne attempted to win a new trial when fellow inmate Tommy Williams told the story of a former cellmate at another prison confessing to the murder of Dufresne''s wife and lover. Warden Norton squashed Dufresne''s hopes out of fear that Andy would inform authorities of the money laundering despite Andy''s promise to remain silent. After spending two months in an area of the prison known as "the hole", during which time Williams was assassinated, Dufresne escaped from Shawshank. He took documental evidence of the laundering scheme with him, which he would later mail to a Portland newspaper. Using the alias Randall Stevens (the name under the illegal accounts) Dufresne visited a number of Portland-area banks, withdrawing approximately p$370,000, money Norton intended to retire with. Dufresne buried some money in a hayfield near Buxton, Maine, at a location only known to his prison friend Ellis Boyd "Red" Redding, then fled to Zihuatanejo, Mexico, where he operated a hotel with charter fishing services for guests. Dufresne was later joined by Redding after Red was paroled and discovered the money Andy left for him in the Buxton hayfield.

Redding was denied parole in 1947 and 1957 despite pleas to the parole board that he had been rehabilitated. Redding was granted parole in 1967 even though he displayed callous indifference to the parole board; afterwards he lived in a halfway house and worked as a bagger at a grocery store. In keeping a promise to his friend, escaped inmate Andy Dufresne, Redding traveled to a hayfield near Buxton, Maine to unearth an item buried near an oak tree and rock wall. The item was a box containing money and an invitation to join Dufresne at his location undisclosed in the letter; Redding knew the site as Zihuatanejo, Mexico from an earlier conversation he had with Dufresne in the prison yard.

So if you can''t top it, steal from them and go out strong. So I picked a guy I thought you''d like. "We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory will swell when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature."'),

And when I say brother, I don''t mean, like, an actual brother, but I mean it like the way black people use it. Which is more meaningful I think. If there is anything that this horrible tragedy can teach us, it''s that a male model''s life is a precious, precious commodity.
